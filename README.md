# Data Analytics Mini Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **Data Analytics Mini Project**, which includes various Jupyter Notebook files to analyze and process different datasets. The project involves working with **fitness tracking data**, **fake data generation**, **data filtering**, and **merging datasets** to extract meaningful insights.

## 📂 Project Files

- **`Fitness Tracker.ipynb`** → Analyzes fitness tracker data from `data.csv`.
- **`Data Filter.ipynb`** → Filters and processes datasets.
- **`Faker Data.ipynb`** → Generates fake data for testing and analysis.
- **`Merge.ipynb`** → Merges multiple datasets into a single dataset.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aishwarya-garje/Data-Analytics.git
   cd Data-Analytics
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn faker
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the `.ipynb` files to analyze the data.

## 📊 Features
- **Fitness Tracker Analysis**: Reads and processes fitness tracker data.
- **Fake Data Generation**: Uses Faker library to create synthetic data.
- **Data Filtering**: Cleans and filters raw data for analysis.
- **Data Merging**: Combines multiple datasets for better insights.

## 📜 Usage
1. Open `Fitness Tracker.ipynb` to analyze fitness data.
2. Use `Faker Data.ipynb` to generate synthetic datasets.
3. Run `Data Filter.ipynb` to filter data based on specific criteria.
4. Execute `Merge.ipynb` to combine different datasets.
